## Why Tiny Changes Make a Big Difference
```sh
1% BETTER EVERY DAY
1% worse every day for one year. 0.99
365 = 00.03
1% better every day for one year. 1.01
365 = 37.78
```
- Habits are the compound interest of selfimprovement.

- Making a choice that is 1 percent better or 1 percent worse
seems insignificant in the moment, but over the span of moments that make up a
lifetime these choices determine the difference between who you are and who
you could be.

- Success is the product of daily habitsâ€”not once-in-a-lifetime
transformations.
