# Atomic Habits

## Why Tiny Changes Make a Big Difference
```sh
1% BETTER EVERY DAY
1% worse every day for one year. 0.99
365 = 00.03
1% better every day for one year. 1.01
365 = 37.78
```
- Habits are the compound interest of selfimprovement.

- Making a choice that is 1 percent better or 1 percent worse
seems insignificant in the moment, but over the span of moments that make up a
lifetime these choices determine the difference between who you are and who
you could be.

- Success is the product of daily habits—not once-in-a-lifetime
transformations.

- You think, “I’ve been running every day for a month, so why can’t I see any
change in my body?” Once this kind of thinking takes over, it’s easy to let good
habits fall by the wayside.
- But in order to make a meaningful difference, habits
need to persist long enough to break through this plateau—what I call the
Plateau of Latent Potential.

- If you find yourself struggling to build a good habit or break a bad one, it is
not because you have lost your ability to improve. It is often because you have
not yet crossed the Plateau of Latent Potential. Complaining about not achieving
success despite working hard is like complaining about an ice cube not melting
when you heated it from twenty-five to thirty-one degrees. Your work was not
wasted; it is just being stored. All the action happens at thirty-two degrees.

```sh
When nothing seems to help, I go and look at a stonecutter
hammering away at his rock, perhaps a hundred times without as much as a
crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I
know it was not that last blow that did it—but all that had gone before.”
```

```sh
FORGET ABOUT GOALS, FOCUS ON SYSTEMS INSTEAD
```

## Problem #1: Winners and losers have the same goals.

## Problem #2: Achieving a goal is only a momentary change.

## Problem #3: Goals restrict your happiness

## Problem #4: Goals are at odds with long-term progress.
