# Atomic Habits

## Why Tiny Changes Make a Big Difference
```sh
1% BETTER EVERY DAY
1% worse every day for one year. 0.99
365 = 00.03
1% better every day for one year. 1.01
365 = 37.78
```
- Habits are the compound interest of selfimprovement.

- Making a choice that is 1 percent better or 1 percent worse
seems insignificant in the moment, but over the span of moments that make up a
lifetime these choices determine the difference between who you are and who
you could be.

- Success is the product of daily habits—not once-in-a-lifetime
transformations.

- You think, “I’ve been running every day for a month, so why can’t I see any
change in my body?” Once this kind of thinking takes over, it’s easy to let good
habits fall by the wayside.
- But in order to make a meaningful difference, habits
need to persist long enough to break through this plateau—what I call the
Plateau of Latent Potential.

- If you find yourself struggling to build a good habit or break a bad one, it is
not because you have lost your ability to improve. It is often because you have
not yet crossed the Plateau of Latent Potential. Complaining about not achieving
success despite working hard is like complaining about an ice cube not melting
when you heated it from twenty-five to thirty-one degrees. Your work was not
wasted; it is just being stored. All the action happens at thirty-two degrees.

```sh
When nothing seems to help, I go and look at a stonecutter
hammering away at his rock, perhaps a hundred times without as much as a
crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I
know it was not that last blow that did it—but all that had gone before.”

FORGET ABOUT GOALS, FOCUS ON SYSTEMS INSTEAD
```

## Problem #1: Winners and losers have the same goals.

## Problem #2: Achieving a goal is only a momentary change.

## Problem #3: Goals restrict your happiness

## Problem #4: Goals are at odds with long-term progress.

# A SYSTEM OF ATOMIC HABITS

- Habits are like the atoms of our lives. Each one is a fundamental unit that
contributes to your overall improvement. At first, these tiny routines seem
insignificant, but soon they build on each other and fuel bigger wins that
multiply to a degree that far outweighs the cost of their initial investment. They
are both small and mighty. This is the meaning of the phrase atomic habits—a
regular practice or routine that is not only small and easy to do, but also the
source of incredible power; a component of the system of compound growth.

# How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)

- once your habits are established, they seem to stick around forever especially the unwanted ones. Despite our best intentions, unhealthy habits like eating junk food, watching too much television, procrastinating, and smoking can feel impossible to break.

- Changing our habits is challenging for two reasons: (1) we try to change the
wrong thing and (2) we try to change our habits in the wrong way

# THREE LAYERS OF BEHAVIOR CHANGE

- The first layer is changing your outcomes. This level is concerned with
changing your results: losing weight, publishing a book, winning a
championship. Most of the goals you set are associated with this level of change.

- The second layer is changing your process. This level is concerned with
changing your habits and systems: implementing a new routine at the gym,
decluttering your desk for better workflow, developing a meditation practice.
Most of the habits you build are associated with this level.

- The third and deepest layer is changing your identity. This level is
concerned with changing your beliefs: your worldview, your self-image, your
judgments about yourself and others. Most of the beliefs, assumptions, and
biases you hold are associated with this level.

- Many people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing on what
they want to achieve. This leads us to outcome-based habits. The alternative is to
build identity-based habits. With this approach, we start by focusing on who we
wish to become.

- There are a set of beliefs and assumptions that shape the system, an
identity behind the habits.

- The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more
motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it.

- You are simply acting like the type of person you already
believe yourself to be.

- Progress requires unlearning.

# THE TWO-STEP PROCESS TO CHANGING YOUR IDENTITY

- The more you repeat a behavior, the more you reinforce the identity
associated with that behavior. In fact, the word identity was originally derived
from the Latin words essentitas, which means being, and identidem, which
means repeatedly. Your identity is literally your “repeated beingness.”

- The more evidence you have for a belief, the more strongly you will believe it.

- As you repeat these actions, however, the evidence
accumulates and your self-image begins to change.

- In this way, the process of building habits is actually the process of
becoming yourself.

- New identities require new evidence
- Decide the type of person you want to be.
- Prove it to yourself with small wins.

- “Who is the type of person that could get the outcome I want?”
- Who is the type of person that could lose forty pounds?
- Who is the type of person that could learn a new language?
- Who is the type of person that could run a successful start-up?

- The concept of identity-based habits is our first introduction to another key
theme in this book: feedback loops.
- Your habits shape your identity, and your identity shapes your habits. It’s a two-way street.
- The formation of all habits is a feedback loop (a concept we will explore in depth in the next chapter), but it’s
important to let your values, principles, and identity drive the loop rather than your results.

# The focus should always be on becoming that type of person, not getting a particular outcome.

- There are three levels of change: outcome change, process change, and
identity change.
The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what
you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become.
Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the
type of person you wish to become.
Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously
edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.
The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better
results (although they can do that), but because they can change your
beliefs about yourself
